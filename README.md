A basic game concept used to demonstrate equally basic AI min/maxing.

##### Goal:  
- To be the player with the highest score after all pieces are taken.

##### Rules:
- You have two move options: **Drop** and **Blitz**.
- **Drop**: Claim an unclaimed piece, and it's points.

- **Blitz**: Claim an unclaimed piece that is adjacent to another piece you already possess. All adjacent pieces to the newly claimed piece that are under enemy possession are now yours, along with their points.
